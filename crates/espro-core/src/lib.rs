//! ElasticVue Pro desktop core.
//!
//! Everything the browser extension delegated to its service worker lives here, plus
//! what a browser could never do: open its own SSH connection to a jump host, decide
//! for itself which certificates to trust, and keep a credential in the OS vault.
//!
//! The UI talks to this crate through one JSON message API (`bridge::Core::handle`),
//! identical in shape to the extension's `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` protocol, so the
//! pages did not have to change.
