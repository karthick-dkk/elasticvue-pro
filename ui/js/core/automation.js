/**
 * Automation — rules that watch continuously and propose work.
 *
 * The split is deliberate. The expensive part of Elasticsearch housekeeping is the
 * checking: comparing every dated index against every snapshot in every repository, over
 * and over, to answer "is this one safe to delete yet". The dangerous part is the deletion,
 * which takes one click. So this automates the checking and leaves the click to a person.
 *
 * A rule never writes. It returns a proposal, the page renders it, and the operator runs it
 * through the same confirmation dialogs and the same two-gate write guard as a manual
 * action. Nothing here can act unattended.
 *
 * Arming (running a rule without a human) is designed for and switched off — see canArm().
